Algorithm Conversion from Octal to Binary
begin:
    read(octal);
    binary_constant[] ← 0, 1, 10, 11, 100, 101, 110, 111;
    binary ← 0; rem ← 0; place ← 1;
    While(octal > 0)
    begin:
        rem ← octal % 10;
        binary ← (binary_constant[rem] * place) + binary;
        octal ← octal / 10;
        place ← place * 1000;
    end;
    write('Binary =' binary);
end;
